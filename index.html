                    <br>
                <p>While I was studying in 10+2 the world was hit by COVID and so was I. 
                    Neverthless while navingating through the hard time, COVID provided an opportunity of window to know myslef and has made me stronger in aspects of life which otherwise i would have never looked into. Time has helped me become a more strong and mature by thought process. </p>
                <br>
                    <p>I love interacting with people and embracing the different cultural thoughts. 
                    Connecting with people has inheriently exposed me to ones culture and food. 
                    My love for food has been grown since and I love tasting different cusinies and cultural dishes.</p>
